SOLIDWORKS add-ins are in-process applications hosted within the **sldworks.exe** process.

When debugging SOLIDWORKS add-ins it is recommended to specify the full path to the SOLIDWORKS executable for the **Start external program** option in the project settings under the **Debug** tab.

In this case it is possible to launch SOLIDWORKS and attach to the process automatically directly form Visual Studio by calling **Start** command or clicking **F5**

To attach to the running SOLIDWORKS instance use the **Debug->Attach To Process...** command

and select **SLDWORKS.exe** process form the list

In addition, xCAD.NET framework allows to debug original source code directly from the nuge package via Source Link. See [Debugging xCAD.NET Source Code](/troubleshooting/#debugging-xcad.net-source-code) article for more information of how to enable Source Link.
