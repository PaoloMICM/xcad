xCAD frameworks enables a simple way to add custom panels to various UI elements such as:

* Task Pane
* Feature Manager
* Model View
* Popup

Both [Windows Forms controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.usercontrol) and [WPF controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.controls.usercontrol) can be rendered in the same way.

Refer [Forms And Wpf Controls](https://github.com/xarial/xcad-examples/tree/master/FormsAndWpfControls) example for the demonstration how the same control can be hosted in different panels of SOLIDWORKS.
