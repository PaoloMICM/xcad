Call **SwApplicationFactory.Create** to connect to SOLIDWORKS instance in one of the following ways:

* To the specified SOLIDWORKS version
* To the latest SOLIDWORKS version (set the value of *vers* parameter to null)
* By optionally providing additional arguments

In order to connect to existing (running process of SOLIDWORKS) use **SwApplicationFactory.FromProcess** method and pass the pointer to [Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process?view=netcore-3.1)
